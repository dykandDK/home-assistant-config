# Home Assistant - configuration and automations
This repository contains a collection of my personnal Home Assistant (HA) configuration and automations.

It may not include the full configuration needed to replicate my setup, but it does include relevant examples of my configuration and automations.

Please feel free to use and change as you like for your own HA setup.

## Lovelace dashboards
I use different Lovelace dashboards:

### Tablet dashboard
This dashboard is optimized for viewing on tablet with screen resolution 1280x800:

See more screenshots [HERE](/screenshots/screenshots.md)

### Smart clock radio dashboard
This dashboard is designed to replace and extend the functionality of an old clock radio. It is designed for viewing on a 8" tablet and includes four different views:

1) Large digital clock display
2) Set alarm timer
3) Play music
4) View weather information

The Swipe-card custom component is used to swipe between the clock and other views.

In addition an icon bar provides easy access to:

- Open CCTV app
- View and enable/disable alarm timer
- View and control home alarm system
- Turn off main lights
- View/set home state

### Mobile device dashboard 
This dashboard is mainly used on mobile devices, and includes additional elements, such as a universal remote:

![Universal remote](https://github.com/dykandDK/home-assistant-config/blob/master/screenshots/06_remote.jpg)

For the time being, only my tablet dashboards are included in this repository.

I prefer to maintain dashboards in YAML mode and I use `!include` statements to make it easier to maintain and re-use relevant parts of each dashboard.

This means that the dashboards are divided into seperate files that are located in the [/include](/include) folder. 

If you prefer to edit your Lovelace dashboard in UI mode, I've created a consolidated version of my tablet dashboard that can be used as a starting point. The file is called `tablet_ui.yaml` and includes most - but not all features - from my YAML version. However, the dashboard should be enough to get get you started.

I still highly recommend to use the YAML version if you are serious about creating a personalized dashboard. The main reasoning behind my recommendation is:

- The YAML version allows you to use include statements to split your file into smaller and more manageable files, which makes it easier to move stuff around or exclude certain elements of the dashboards. It also allows you to reuse code across multiple views or dashboards and just maintain the code one place. This is particularly useful for the header bar that is used in each view of the dashboard

- The YAML version also supports insertion of comments in the code. This is useful to document your code but can also be use to quickly disable parts of your code without having to delete it entirely.

My lovelace dashboards would simply not be possible without these custom cards. So a special shout out and million thanks goes out to all developers for their contributions to the Home Assistant community.

## Automations
I mainly use node-RED for automations. HA scripts and automations are excluded from this repository.

Examples of my node-RED automations can be found [HERE](/automations/node-RED/node-RED.md).
